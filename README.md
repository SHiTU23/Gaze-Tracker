> Use **Pupil Service** Software.
>    + Adjust the camera to have your pupile visible in all angles, even the very extreme ones.
>   + Turning your head while staring at a certain point on the screen, makes it easier to addjust the camera.
>   + **Dark Blue circle around your eyeball** : means the camera is well adjusted and is fit to the eyeball.
>   + **Light Blue circle around your eyeball** : means the eyemodel is not well-fitted.
>   + **Red Dot on Pupil** : means that your pupil is detectable in that angle. Adjust the camera in a way to have this ***red dot*** always on your pupil while you are looking at a point with different angles.
> > 
> + Adjust the World Camera\
> Use **Pupil Capture** software.
